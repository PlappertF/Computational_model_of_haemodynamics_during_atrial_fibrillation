# Computational model of haemodynamics during atrial fibrillation
Welcome to this repo containing the supplementary material for our publication 'Computational model of haemodynamics during atrial fibrillation'. The work has been published in The Journal of Physiology with the doi: coming soon.

## Introduction
We developed a computational model that simulates beat-to-beat haemodynamic changes resulting from the unco-ordinated atrial and irregular electrical activation times characteristic of AF.
